
In Movement, the current player can move units from one country to another, provided that both countries are:
- Ruled by the same player.
- Connected by a chain of countries ruled by that player.
A valid troop movement will be shown by a line linking the selected countries.

How to:
1. Select the origin country. Must have more than one unit.
2. Select the destination country. If the movement is valid, a link will be shown.
3. Click 'Fortify' to move one unit.
