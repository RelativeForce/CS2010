At the end of each round, environmental hazards may randomly occur in any country. 

These hazards will randomly kill a percentage of the army stationed at the country the hazard occurred in.

Hazards appear as icons over the countries they have affected.

Each has a unique icon, click or hover over it to bring up a tool tip displaying more information about the hazard.
