Environmental Hazards pt.1
After the first round, environmental hazards may occur in any country. 

These hazards will kill a random percentage of the army stationed at the country the hazard occurred in.

These hazards appear as icons over the countries they have affected.

Each hazard has a unique icon and you can click on that icon to find out which hazard it is.
