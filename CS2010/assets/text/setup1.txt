
In Setup, the players select who initially owns which countries.
To set the ruler of a country, simply click on the country then press the number button that corresponds to the number of the player. For example: '1' corresponds to 'Player 1'. 'Space' makes the country neutral.
Click 'Auto' to randomly divide all the countries equally, between all the players.
Once you have assigned the countries as you desire click 'Play' to start the game.
