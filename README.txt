Welcome to the PERIL!

This is a student project for CS2010 at Aston University. Written 
from 2017-2018. Developed by The Strategic Goats (Group 5).

Peril is a turn-based strategy game inspired by the board game 
Risk. It combines the strategy of risk with new elements such as 
environmental hazards and blockades. The game currently supports 
up to 2-4 player hot seat multiplayer and three Peril tailored maps.

Please read the instructions before playing and try to have fun. Game 
instructions can be found on the main menu by clicking 'Help'.

System Requirements:
Memory: 7 GB
Display: 1280x720 or larger
OS: Windows 10 - 64 bit

NOTE: The memory resources that the game uses vary and in stress testing 
have shown use up to 2.6 GB RAM when 4 AI are playing at 4x speed. This 
reason is why 7 GB is recommended as it will allow the game to perform 
normally.
